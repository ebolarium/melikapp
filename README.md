## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- Create React App
- JavaScript/JSX
- Axios for API calls

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Simple Authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- CORS for cross-origin requests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode (Both Frontend & Backend)
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Backend Only
```bash
npm run server
# or
npm start
```

#### Frontend Only
```bash
npm run client
```

#### Production Build
```bash
npm run build    # Build React app
npm start        # Start production server
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000` and in development mode, the frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`. In production, the backend serves the React app.
